# Linear_Regression_Example

# Linear Regression Project

This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict sales using a provided dataset.

## Project Structure

Important files and folders in the project:

- `veri.xlsx`: The dataset utilized in the project.
- `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model creation steps.
- `README.md`: This document, offering an overview of the project and instructions for its execution.

## Getting Started

Install required libraries: pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Open and run Linear_Regression.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.

## Notebook Steps

Outlined below are the key steps covered in the Jupyter Notebook:

- Reading and Exploring the Dataset
- Dataset Summary and Information
- Checking for Missing Values and Duplicates
- Copying the Dataset for Manipulation
- Visualizing Relationships using Seaborn
- Splitting Data into Features and Target Variable
- Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Building a Linear Regression Model
